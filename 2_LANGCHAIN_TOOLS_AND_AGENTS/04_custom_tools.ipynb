    "## Summary & Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Learned 🎓\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you've mastered creating custom tools for LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Creation**: Built tools using `Tool` class, `@tool` decorator, and `StructuredTool` classes\n",
    "2. **Function Wrapping**: Converted Python functions into LangChain tools using multiple methods\n",
    "3. **Decorator Usage**: Used the `@tool` decorator for clean, automatic tool creation\n",
    "4. **Input Validation**: Used Pydantic models for structured tool inputs\n",
    "5. **Financial Tools**: Created practical tools for financial calculations and data lookup\n",
    "6. **Agent Integration**: Combined multiple tools into a comprehensive financial agent\n",
    "7. **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling in tool functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Tools Created 🛠️\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculator Tool**: Basic mathematical operations using Tool() class\n",
    "- **Percentage Calculator**: Percentage calculations using @tool decorator\n",
    "- **Compound Interest Calculator**: Advanced financial calculations with detailed output\n",
    "- **Stock Price Lookup**: Mock financial data retrieval with comprehensive metrics\n",
    "- **Portfolio Value Calculator**: Multi-asset portfolio analysis and diversification insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Mastered 🔑\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool Class**: Creating tools from functions with descriptions\n",
    "- **@tool Decorator**: Simple, clean tool creation with automatic schema generation\n",
    "- **StructuredTool**: Advanced tools with typed inputs and validation\n",
    "- **Pydantic Schemas**: Defining input structures for tools\n",
    "- **Agent Integration**: Using tools with LangChain agents\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Robust error management in tool functions\n",
    "- **Tool Descriptions**: Writing clear descriptions for agent use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Creation Methods 🛠️\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool() Class Method**\n",
    "   - Explicit control over all parameters\n",
    "   - Good for simple functions\n",
    "   - Manual schema definition\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **@tool Decorator Method**\n",
    "   - Clean, Pythonic syntax\n",
    "   - Automatic schema generation from function signature\n",
    "   - Best for straightforward tools\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **StructuredTool.from_function()**\n",
    "   - Advanced input validation with Pydantic\n",
    "   - Complex parameter schemas\n",
    "   - Best for sophisticated tools with multiple parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Custom Tools 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Descriptions**\n",
    "   - Write descriptive tool names and descriptions\n",
    "   - Explain input parameters clearly\n",
    "   - Include examples in descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Validation**\n",
    "   - Use Pydantic models for structured inputs\n",
    "   - Validate data types and ranges\n",
    "   - Handle edge cases gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**\n",
    "   - Wrap tool functions in try-catch blocks\n",
    "   - Return meaningful error messages\n",
    "   - Don't let tools crash the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Formatting**\n",
    "   - Return well-formatted, readable responses\n",
    "   - Include relevant context and explanations\n",
    "   - Use consistent formatting across tools\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Testing**\n",
    "   - Test tools independently before agent integration\n",
    "   - Test with various input scenarios\n",
    "   - Verify error handling works correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create more specialized financial tools\n",
    "- Add real API integrations for live data\n",
    "- Build tools that work together for complex workflows\n",
    "- Explore advanced agent architectures\n",
    "- Move on to multi-agent systems!\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent work! You now have the skills to create powerful custom tools that extend LangChain's capabilities! 🎉"
