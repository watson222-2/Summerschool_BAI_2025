In the second year, you would earn 5% interest on $105, not just on your original $100. This means you would earn $5.25 in interest (5% of $105), bringing your total balance to $110.25. \n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, make sure you have an emergency fund set aside with enough to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. This will provide a financial safety net in case of unexpected expenses.\n",

      "3. **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance. At 25, you have a longer time horizon, which may allow you to take on more risk for potentially higher returns. However, it's important to find a balance between growth and security that aligns with your comfort level.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Retirement Savings**: Consider starting to contribute to a retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages and can help you build wealth over the long term.\n",

      "5. **Educate Yourself**: Take the time to educate yourself about investing. Consider reading books, taking online courses, or seeking advice from a financial advisor to make informed decisions.\n",

      "6. **Stay Informed**: Keep track of your investments and stay informed about market trends. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio as needed to ensure it remains aligned with your financial goals.\n",
